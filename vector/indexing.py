# In python, the indexing starts from zero. 
# You can select the second element of the vector 'v' as follows:
'''v=[ 4 ]
     [-1 ]
     [ 2 ] i.e. v=-1'''

# importing required libraries (numpy as np)
import numpy as np
vector=np.array([[4],[-1],[2]])
print("The vector\n",vector)
#Addressing a value of vector by index
print("\nElement at position 1=",vector[1])
